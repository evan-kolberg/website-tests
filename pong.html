        <h2>
        One and Two player pong
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        This can be one and two player pong.<br>
        Pick one or two players.<br>
        Then pick music or no music. <br>
        If the game asks 1-4, then restart it.<br>
        That is one of two bugs i have noticed<br>
        I am in the process of fixing it. <br>
        It seems to be time related.<br>
        So pick fast.<br>
        then pick the type of music.<br>
        Then pick 1-4, which decides the angle that launches the ball.<br>
        This doesnt have speed control.<br>
